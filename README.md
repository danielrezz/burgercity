<p>
    This application was built using jQuery, mySQL, express, and the template engine Handlebars. Please excuse our mess as our site is still under construction.

<h2>
    Content
</h2>

<p>
    When you open up the project, you will find the landing page that contains 3 main sections: Order Up, Delicious, and Cook. When you "grill up" an order, the burger will be placed on the main Order section. You can then choose to eat it (it will appear in the Delicious section) or trash it, but that would be wasteful.

<h2>
    Challenges
</h2>

<p>
    There were plenty of challenges when creating this app. First of all, Handlebars is still something I am not totally comfortable with. It's tricky getting the keys and values correct. 

    Creating the different route requests were also tricky and I often had to look at a sample project done in class for reference.
